## Reporting a Vulnerability
In order for the vulnerability reports to reach maintainers as soon as possible, the preferred way is to use the "Report a vulnerability" button under the "Security" tab of the associated GitHub project. This creates a private communication channel between the reporter and the maintainers.

If you are absolutely unable to or have strong reasons not to use GitHub's vulnerability reporting workflow, please reach out to [security@jpadilla.com](mailto:security@jpadilla.com).
